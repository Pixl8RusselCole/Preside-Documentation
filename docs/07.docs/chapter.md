## Mission statement

Good documentation is at the heart of all successful open source projects. With this platform, we aim to:

* Provide a platform that is easy to contribute to and maintain
* Provide documentation that is a joy to read and navigate
* Provide a system that can build the same documentation source to multiple output formats
* Provide stewardship such that the documentation is well kept and ever-growing

## Contributing

This documentation is built from a folder within the main PresideCMS source repository. The folder can be found at [https://github.com/pixl8/Preside-CMS/tree/stable/support/docs](https://github.com/pixl8/Preside-CMS/tree/stable/support/docs).

You'll find information on ways in which you can contribute in the [[docs-content]] and [[docs-build]] sections.

## Technology

### Lucee

The documentation build is achieved using Lucee code. The only dependency required to build and locally run the documentation is [CommandBox](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox).

### Markdown

We chose to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with a few common and custom enhancements.

We also based the system on a popular open source static CMS system called [Grav](http://getgrav.org). This gives us a proven foundation to build the source from and should help make contributing as easy as it can be.

For more information on how the documentation is formatted, see the [[docs-content]] section.
